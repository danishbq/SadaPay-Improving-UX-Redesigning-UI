# SadaPay-Improving-UX-Redesigning-UI

SadaPay facilitates financial services, like money-management, and digital payments. Users can make and receive online payments, use its virtual and physical debit cards through a mobile app. It is essentially an e-Wallet that replaces cash transactions. The idea behind SadaPay is to make financial transactions as quick, easy and affordable as possible, by eliminating a middle agent like banks, and by avoiding redundant transaction costs. In addition, it strives to make the process of sending and receiving money easy and user-friendly, by making the app as simple as possible.

The first report shares the findings of the user survey, particularly:
1.	SadaPayâ€™s user experience and user interface design from the perspective of its consumers
2.	Identify good aspects of its features and how they are used
3.	Identify problems and how they can be improved

The second report gives a detailed summary and descriptions of the enhancements made and new features added to the SadaPay mobile application in the form of a prototype. The prototype is constructed using the web-based application, Figma
